The aim is to provide a step-by-step guide to set up a data lake with the required security governance .\r\n\r\n## Audience will learn to: \r\n\r\n- Build an end-to-end streaming data pipeline\r\n\r\n- Understand the features of AWS Lake Formation and Amazon Forecast\r\n\r\n- Apply AWS best practices and design principles\r\n\r\n- Use Amazon QuickSight to visualize data in near real-time.\r\n\r\n\r\n## AWS Services used:\r\n\r\nAWS Services                        | Description\r\n------------                        | -------------\r\nAmazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)  | used to store and protect any amount of data, from anywhere in the web.\r\nAWS Lake Formation | service that makes it easy to set up a secure data lake in days.\r\nAmazon Relational Database Service (RDS) | optimised for memory, performance that can scale a relational database in the cloud. \r\nAWS Glue | ETL service to categorize data for cleaning, enriching and transforming between various data stores.\r\nAmazon Forecast | an AWS AI service that uses machine learning to generate forecasts from your data.\r\nAthena | for querying the data you import into your data lake.\r\nAmazon QuickSight | perform ad hoc analysis, and get insights from your data.\r\n\r\n## Representation of the solution:\r\n<img src = \"https://github.com/Aniket-Gamre/An-end-to-end-automated-AWS-Data-Lake-Formation-using-Amazon-Forecast/blob/master/Design-flow%20diagrams/Final%20Solution.PNG\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Note: \r\nYou can make use of the sample bookings dataset provided in this repository that can be uploaded into your s3 bucket for completion of this tutorial. \r\n\r\n\r\n## References:\r\nAWS Documentation, Online training materials etc.\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
