# Building-an-end-to-end-automated-forecasting-capability-with-AWS-Data-Lake-Formation-and-Forecast

This tutorial intends to build an automated forecasting capability for bookings data leveraging AWS services such as AWS Lake Formation and Amazon Forecast. The aim is to provide a step-by-step guide to set up a data lake with the required security governance .

## Audience will learn to: 

- Build an end-to-end streaming data pipeline

- Understand the features of AWS Lake Formation and Amazon Forecast

- Apply AWS best practices and design principles

- Use Amazon QuickSight to visualize data in near real-time.


## AWS Services used:

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) - used to store and protect any amount of data, from anywhere in the web.

AWS Lake Formation- a service that makes it easy to set up a secure data lake in days.

Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) - optimised for memory, performance that can scale a relational database in the cloud. 

AWS Glue - ETL service to categorize data for cleaning, enriching and transforming between various data stores.

Amazon Forecast- an AWS AI service that uses machine learning to generate forecasts from your data.

Athena- for querying the data you import into your data lake.

Amazon QuickSight- perform ad hoc analysis, and get insights from your data.
